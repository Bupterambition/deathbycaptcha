DeathByCaptcha
==============

DeathByCaptcha is a Ruby API for acessing the http://www.deathbycaptcha.com services.

It supports HTTP and socket-based connections, with the latter being recommended for having faster responses and overall better performance.

When using socket connections, make sure that outgoing TCP traffic to <b>api.deathbycaptcha.com</b> to the ports range in <b>8123-8130</b> is not blocked by your firewall.

Thread-safety note
------------------

The API is thread-safe, which means it is perfectly fine to share a client instance between multiple threads.

Installation
------------

You can install the latest DeathByCaptcha gem with:

	gem install deathbycaptcha

You can add it to your Gemfile:

	gem 'deathbycaptcha'

#### Decoding captcha

##### From URL

	response = client.decode 'http://www.phpcaptcha.org/securimage/securimage_show.php'

	puts "captcha id: #{response['captcha']}, solution: #{response['text']}, is_correct: #{response['is_correct']}}"

##### From file path

	puts "captcha id: #{response['captcha']}, solution: #{response['text']}, is_correct: #{response['is_correct']}}"

##### From a file

	file = File.open('path/to/my/captcha/file', 'r')

	response = client.decode file

	puts "captcha id: #{response['captcha']}, solution: #{response['text']}, is_correct: #{response['is_correct']}}"

##### From raw content

	response = client.decode(raw_content, :is_raw_content => true)

	puts "captcha id: #{response['captcha']}, solution: #{response['text']}, is_correct: #{response['is_correct']}}"
