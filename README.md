# DeathByCaptcha

DeathByCaptcha is a Ruby API for DeathByCaptcha - http://www.deathbycaptcha.com.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'deathbycaptcha', '~> 5.0.0'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install deathbycaptcha

## Usage

1. **Create a client**

  ```ruby
  # Create a client (:socket and :http clients are available)
  client = DeathByCaptcha.new('myusername', 'mypassword', :http)
  ```

2. **Solve a captcha**
  2.1. **Commom captcha**

    There are two methods available: **decode** and **decode!**
      * **decode** doesn't raise exceptions.
      * **decode!** may raise a *DeathByCaptcha::Error* if something goes wrong.

    If the solution is not available, an empty captcha object will be returned.

    ```ruby
    captcha = client.decode(url: 'http://bit.ly/1xXZcKo')
    captcha.text        # Solution of the captcha
    captcha.id          # Numeric ID of the captcha solved by DeathByCaptcha
    captcha.is_correct  # true if the solution is correct
    ```

    You can also specify *path*, *file*, *raw* and *raw64* when decoding an image.

    ```ruby
    client.decode(path: 'path/to/my/captcha/file')

    client.decode(file: File.open('path/to/my/captcha/file', 'rb'))

    client.decode(raw: File.open('path/to/my/captcha/file', 'rb').read)

    client.decode(raw64: Base64.encode64(File.open('path/to/my/captcha/file', 'rb').read))
    ```
  2.2. **New Recaptcha**

    DeathByCaptcha now supports new recaptcha. For these captchas, there are two
    ways of solving captcha:

    2.2.1. **Coordinates**

      ```ruby
      captcha = client.decode(url: 'http://bit.ly/1xXZcKo', type: 2)
      ```
      This will return a array of duples that represent image's coordinates X
      and Y that were clicked.

    2.2.2. **Position**

      This method requires more arguments.

      ```ruby
      args = {}
      args[:url]         = 'http://bit.ly/1xXZcKo'
      args[:banner]      = { url: 'http://bit.ly/1xXZcKo' }
      args[:banner_text] = 'Recaptcha text'
      args[:type]        = 3
      captcha = client.decode!(args)
      ```

      This will return a string with the array of clicked positions.

  > Internally, the gem will always convert the images to raw64 (binary base64 encoded).

3. **Retrieve a previously solved captcha**

  ```ruby
  captcha = client.captcha('130920620') # with 130920620 as the captcha id
  ```

4. **Report incorrectly solved captcha for refund**

  ```ruby
  captcha = client.report!('130920620') # with 130920620 as the captcha id
  ```

  > ***Warning:*** *do not abuse on this method, otherwise you may get banned*

5. **Retrieve your user information (which has the current credit balance)**

  ```ruby
  user = client.user()
  user.is_banned  # true if the user is banned
  user.balance    # Credit balance in US cents
  user.rate       # Captcha rate, i.e. charges for one solved captcha in US cents
  user.id         # Numeric ID of your account
  ```

6. **Retrieve DeathByCaptcha server status**

  ```ruby
  status = client.status()
  status.todays_accuracy        # Current accuracy of DeathByCaptcha
  status.solved_in              # Estimated seconds to solve a captcha right now
  status.is_service_overloaded  # true if DeathByCaptcha is overloaded/unresponsive
  ```

## Notes

#### Thread-safety

The API is thread-safe, which means it is perfectly fine to share a client
instance between multiple threads.

#### HTTP and Socket clients

The API supports HTTP and socket-based connections, with the latter being
recommended for having faster responses and overall better performance. The two
clients have the same methods/interface.

When using the socket client, make sure that outgoing TCP traffic to
**api.dbcapi.me** to the ports in range **8123-8130** is not blocked by your
firewall.

> We are currently suggesting developers to use HTTP connection because Socket
> seems to be unstable with older Ruby versions. While we are investigating,
> consider using only HTTP connection.

#### Ruby dependencies

DeathByCaptcha >= 5.0.0 don't require specific dependencies. That saves you
memmory and avoid conflicts with other gems.

#### Input image format

Any format you use in the decode method (url, file, path, raw, raw64) will
always be converted to a raw64, which is a binary base64 encoded string. So, if
you already have this format available on your side, there's no need to do
convertions before calling the API.

> Our recomendation is to never convert your image format, unless needed. Let
> the gem convert internally. It may save you resources (CPU, memmory and IO).

#### Versioning

We no longer follow the versioninig system of the official clients of
DeathByCaptcha. We have bumped to version 5.0.0 and will use
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) from now on.

#### Upgrade from 4.x to 5.x

Any 5.x version is incompatible with any 4.x version. Please, review your code
before upgrading.

#### Ruby versions

This gem has been tested on the following versions of Ruby:

* MRI 2.2.0
* MRI 2.1.5
* MRI 2.0.0
* MRI 1.9.3
